* **Paper Name:-** Graph-based Hub Gene Selection Technique using Protein Interaction Information: Application to  Sample Classification
>This paper explores the information of protein-protein interaction (PPI) with a graph mining technique for finding a proper subset of features (genes), which further takes part in sample classification. Here, our contribution for feature selection is three-fold: firstly, all the genes are grouped into different clusters based on the integrated information of the gene expression values and their protein interactions using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) based clustering approach. Secondly, the confidence scores of the protein interactions are incorporated in a popular graph mining algorithm namely Goldberg algorithm to find out the relevant features. These features are the topologically and functionally significant genes, named as hub genes. Finally, these hub genes are identified varying the degrees of the nodes, and those are utilized for the sample classification task.
